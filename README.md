# Hackm_hackerearth_hackathon_2018


This repo contain the code i wrote hackm hackathon mumbai 2018 india.
I have submitted the idea under the given theme

### Regulatory Tech >> SUB-THEMES >>  Online portal to map and predict spread of communicable diseases


```
Context: A report released by ICMR titled “India: Health of nation’s states” states that about 24% of the annual deaths reported across Maharashtra occur due to spread of communicable diseases such as Swine flu, Dengue and Malaria etc. 
Mapping of such diseases can help administrators, policy makers and epidemiologists to study as well as implement control measures. 
Current records, maintained by state and local agencies can be initially leveraged to develop base disease maps.
These maps need to be periodically updated through centralized IT systems, which can analyse and help predict the spread patterns across the region.

Problem Statement: Build a data mapping solution through a centralized IT system that can analyse the severity and predict the disease spread pattern.
